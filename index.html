    <h1> Meringue Roll  </h1>
    <p> This Summer Berry Meringue Roll consists of a soft, light, and airy meringue filled with mascarpone frosting and fresh berries </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Egg whites 200g</li>
      <li>Lemon juice 1 tbsp.l.</li>
      <li>Sugar 300g</li>
      <li>Corn starch 2 tbsp.l.</li>
      <li>Cream 33% 150g</li>
      <li>Mascarpone 250g</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar 50g</li>
      <li>Berries 200g</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>We put the egg whites to beat. First at a slow speed of the mixer, then increase the speed. When the bubbles in the whites become the same size, you can pour in the sugar. Add sugar little by little. It is better to use fine sugar or replace it with powdered sugar.</li>
    <li> Once all the sugar has been added, pour in the lemon juice.</li>
    <li> Once the meringue is ready, add the cornstarch and mix well.</li>
    <li>Spread the meringue on the parchment paper and level it out. This amount of ingredients makes a 1-1.5 cm layer/ Then place the tray with the meringue in a preheated oven at 150Â°C (top and bottom heat) for 30 minutes.The finished meringue will turn slightly brown and develop a thin sugar crust.</li>
    <li>Turn the still-hot meringue cake onto another sheet of parchment or a silicone mat. Remove the parchment on which it was baked. Leave to cool.</li>
    <li>Put the cold mascarpone, cold cream, and sifted powdered sugar in a mixer bowl.Beat at medium speed with a mixer until the consistency of thick sour cream.</li>
    <li>Assembly. Leave a couple of tablespoons of cream. Spread the remaining cream on the meringue cake. Roll the pastry, starting from the edge that is completely covered with cream (we need the remaining cream to fix the fresh berries on the roll)</li>
